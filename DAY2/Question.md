# Day 2: Questions

## Question 4: Find GCD of two numbers

**Problem:**  
Given two integers N1 and N2, find their greatest common divisor.

Example 1:
Input:N1 = 9, N2 = 12

Output:3
Explanation:Factors of 9: 1, 3 and 9
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Common Factors: 1, 3 out of which 3 is the greatest hence it is the GCD.
Example 2:
Input:N1 = 20, N2 = 15

Output: 5
Explanation:Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5
Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5
Common Factors: 1, 5 out of which 5 is the greatest hence it is the GCD.

## Question 5: Check if a number is Armstrong Number or not

**Problem:**  
Given an integer N, return true it is an Armstrong number otherwise return false.

Example 1:
Input:N = 153
Output:True
Explanation: 13+53+33 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
Example 2:
Input:N = 371
Output: True
Explanation: 33+53+13 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371

## Question 6: Print all Divisors of a given Number

**Problem:**  
Given an integer N, return all divisors of N.

**Example:**  
Example 1:
Input:N = 36
Output:[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36]
Explanation: The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.
Example 2:
Input:N =12
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
Explanation: The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.

## Question 7: Check if a number is prime or not

**Problem:**  
Given an integer N, check whether it is prime or not. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself and the total number of divisors is 2.

**Example:**
Example 1:
Input:N = 2
Output:True
Explanation: 2 is a prime number because it has two divisors: 1 and 2 (the number itself).
Example 2:
Input:N =10
Output: False
Explanation: 10 is not prime, it is a composite number because it has 4 divisors: 1, 2, 5 and 10.
